# deep-learning-lab
Below given list of experiments that are performed and executed in deep learninglab together with there results which are being included in the repository


EXP1:Handwritten digit classification using ann using numpy


EXP2:Observing the behaviour of a perceptron on linear and a non linear dataset and then adding a hidden layer to improve its performance on the non linear dataset


EXP3:The objective of this lab is to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images in the Cats vs. Dogs dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. You will explore different configurations by experimenting with:
● 3 Activation Functions
● 3 Weight Initialization Techniques
● 3 Optimizers
Additionally, you will compare your best CNN model for both datasets with a pretrained ResNet-18 model.


EXP4:To explore Text Generation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and understand the impact of different word representations:
1.One-Hot Encoding
2.Trainable Word Embeddings Additionally, to train both the RNN and LSTM models on a Dataset of 100 poems and compare their performances.
